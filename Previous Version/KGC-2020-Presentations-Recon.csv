2,Bryon Jacob,data.world,A Data Catalog should be your organization's first Knowledge Graph,"In this presentation, we'll cover why a data catalog is the first knowledge graph that an organization should build.  Most organizations don't have a clear picture of their data assets and how they're being used - a data datalog helps provide that picture and unlock the value of data.  We'll explore why a data catalog is a knowledge graph, and how a data catalog can be used as a foundational asset to build more granular domain and application knowledge graphs.

This talk will review knowledge graphs in the supply chain and look into the details of implementation. In our central case, using a semantic model, we build a ‘digital twin’ of a complex inventory management supply chain. Data from heterogeneous sources - including warehouse management systems, point of sale systems and weather data – are then imported into the knowledge graph. Using the graph we carry out analytics, optimization, scheduling and Monte Carlo simulations. A complex set of operations built around the central supply chain knowledge graph. The net result is a predictive analytic system that delivers real value to the enterprise (up to a 50% reduction in inventory). The knowledge graph can be extended to include product information and other central commercial data use cases. This presentation will draw on the production delivery of TerminusDB to the largest retailer in Ireland.",knowledge graph,Q33002955,,

Through a series of focused experiments and prototype building, aided by user studies and feedback, we have explored linking and displaying connections between library catalog data and linked data sources such as Wikidata and DbPedia as well as library authorities such as FAST, Library of Congress Subject Headings, and the Library of Congress Name Authority File.   Examples of areas we investigated for the integration of linked data include: knowledge panels bringing in contextual information and relationships from knowledge graphs like Wikidata to describe people and subjects related to library resources in the catalog; suggested searches based on user-entered queries using results from Wikidata and DbPedia; and browsing experiences for subjects and authors bringing in relationships and data from Wikidata and library authorities.

10,Konstantin Todorov,University of Montpellier / CNRS  / LIRMM,A knowledge graph of controversial claims and its applications,"Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (e.g., events, entities). These data constitute a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. While knowledge graphs of today enable data reuse and federation thus improving information retrieval and facilitating research and knowledge discovery in various fields, they do not store information about claims and related online discourse data, making it difficult to access, query and reuse this wealth of information. In my talk, I will present recent work in collaboration with the Leibniz Institute of Social Sciences GESIS (Germany), on the construction of ClaimsKG - a knowledge graph of fact-checked controversial claims, which facilitates structured queries about their truth values, authors, dates, journalistic reviews and other kinds of metadata and provides ground truth data for a number of tasks relevant to the analysis of societal debates on the web. I will discuss perspectives on modelling claims in a generalized and contextualized manner, as well as related challenges such as claim disambiguation and the assessment of claim relatedness. I will present preliminary results on learning claim vector representations (embeddings) from ClaimsKG and their application for the task of automatic fact-checking.",knowledge graph,Q33002955,,

11,Nicolas Seyot,Morgan Stanley,Automated Knowledge Base creation in a large financial services organization,"The Information Management team at Morgan Stanley has built an RDF graph and a semantic knowledge base to help answer domain specific questions, formulate classification recommendations and deliver quality search to our internal users. In doing so over the past 4 years, we also helped other departments across the firm discover and embrace semantic data modeling for their own use cases. In the first part of our presentation, we would like to briefly describe the Semantic Modeling and Ontology consortium we created within the Firm before diving deeper into our knowledge base creation effort. We think that a knowledge base reflecting concepts specifically relevant to our company is extremely valuable to develop semantic technology applications. However, populating knowledge bases can be time consuming, costly and error prone, with an end product that is difficult to maintain. In the second part of this presentation, we would like to discuss a framework for automatic generation of a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) knowledge base from unstructured text. Our Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine parses the input text to create a semantic knowledge graph, which is then mapped to a SKOS knowledge model. During the linguistic understanding of the text, relevant domain concepts are identified and connected by semantic links -- abstractions of underlying relations between concepts that capture the overall meaning of text based on a corpus of roughly 6,500 policies and procedures published at Morgan Stanley.",knowledge graph,Q33002955,,

Because building a knowledge graph means you are consolidating your important knowledge assets, and that forces you to think of the “bigger picture” of all the data you have in your organization including shared, common domain models. You are not merely shoving data into a warehouse, but actually thinking how different things connect and fit together. Once built, the graph can serve as the source of data for many applications, including Machine and Deep Learning use cases. In this talk, we will walk through the typical tasks involved in building a knowledge graph, options for data modeling and querying (e.g., RDF and Property Graph), as well as tools and integrations.

It is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas for recipes, fashion, weddings, home decoration, and much more. In the last year, the company decided to create a knowledge graph that aims to represent the vast amount of content and users on Pinterest, to help both content recommendation and ads targeting. In this talk, we present the engineering of an ontology--the Pinterest Taxonomy--that forms the core of Pinterest's knowledge graph, the Pinterest Taste Graph. We describe modeling choices and enhancements to the cloud-based WebProtégé tool that we used for the creation of the ontology. In two months, eight Pinterest engineers, without prior experience of ontologies, knowledge graphs, and WebProtégé, revamped an existing taxonomy of noisy terms into an OWL ontology, which they then combine with additional structured information and machinery to form the Pinterest Taste Graph.

The graph incorporates hundreds of millions of entities such as properties, addresses, individual and commercial owners, lenders, brokers, estate managers, lawyers etc. as nodes – while the edges are various types of connections between the entities. A wealth of attributes are associated with each entity. Cherre’s knowledge graph is a closed-world graph: it allows inferring an absence of connection between two entities if there is no edge between them in the graph. Furthermore, Cherre’s graph is temporal: edges and nodes are being added and deleted on a timely basis. Some of the main challenges in constructing a closed-world graph from noisy data sources are entity resolution and disambiguation. In this talk, we will present parallel algorithms for entity resolution and disambiguation in Cherre’s knowledge graph, and outline our current work on assessing entity similarities using (temporal) node embedding.",knowledge graph,Q33002955,,

This means that companies go through great lengths to collect all of our data, sometimes even crossing ethical boundaries.

As a result, innovation has come to a standstill, and people are stuck with mediocre data experiences.

If data truly is the new oil, then what we’re currently doing is pouring all that oil in barrels—often without the ability to open the lid ourselves. In order for data to fuel the engine, it has to flow much better than it does today.

19,Topojoy Biswas,Yahoo/Verizon Media,Machine learning in Yahoo Knowledge Graph,"The Yahoo Knowledge(YK) graph crawls, reconciles and blends information (around 10B fact triples) from 200 M entities across 30 semi-structured source (crawlable sites like Wikipedia, IMDB, LonelyPlanet etc and as well licensed feeds) graphs  to a merged graph of 75 M entities, 5B facts distributed across 140 entity types and 300 attributes.  From classifying entity type of source entities, to reconcile entities across sources (e.g. Brad Pitt from Wikipedia vs. Brad Pitt from IMDB), and blending conflicting and complementing facts for each entity from different sources, the YK graph encapsulates production scale machine learning solutions for multi-label classification(e.g. predicted entity types for Arnold Schwarzenegger could be Actor, Politician, BusinessPerson etc ), large scale high precision binary classifiers along with an array of distributed hashing techniques help scale a potential billion edge comparisons (de-duplication of entities across sources require high precision classifiers for which we develop active learning and precision clamped training strategies) and lastly hubs and authorities based fact blending from competing sources. To support product initiatives like surfacing knowledge augmented results on web and sponsored searches we build a variety of ""knowledge discovery"" services like 1. knowledge triples based question answering and reading comprehension type question answering utilizing our blended/merged knowledge graph, 2. related entities for a given entity to other connected entities beyond direct ontological relations to generate browsing interest to other sites/properties in Yahoo. In contrast to broad cross domain knowledge, we delve into deep domain specific information extraction from news text and videos to power unique experiences for brands like Yahoo! Sports. Specifically for US Sports (NBA/NFL/NHL/MLB/Soccer) our text information extraction sits in the cross roads of fact finding in articles, fine grained entity typing and topical extractive summarization of temporal topics like trades/contracts/injuries and performances connecting player and potential teams to provide 360 degree browsing of daily fantasy news/sports rumors. Through our Video deep linking capabilities we link moments in highlight videos to points in time of a game such that we can power within-video search/browse experiences for e.g. queries like ""Lebron Jame's dunks from yesterday"" would seek to exact moments in a highlight video where LeBron dunked or ""Laker's top scorer's tonight"" would find the stats of the top Laker's scorers, followed by seeking to exact moments of their plays in highlight videos.",knowledge graph,Q33002955,,

Partners LLC,Using FIBO: A Use-Case Driven Cooks Tour,"The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) has matured in significant areas over the last few years, but until recently there were few examples to help users understand how to interpret it and build it into their own knowledge graphs. Since early 2019, the FIBO development team has been focused primarily on use cases to address the steep learning curve: 
• How to represent businesses and incorporate data about them that is publicly available, such as identifiers, locations, ownership and control information and other details from the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), Open Corporates, state and government registries, etc.,
• How to use that information to investigate counterparty relationships,
• How to build on that baseline to represent securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) issued by these organizations,
• How to leverage those securities to represent the components of an index and track index performance, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
• How to use this information to represent more complex derivative instruments.
In this talk, we will take a quick cook’s tour through some of the more basic use cases and related ontologies. The approach that FIBO has taken to build a use case stack that can be used to demonstrate the value of knowledge graphs translates well to most domain-specific projects. The use cases, ontologies, and reference and example data are all publicly available and open source. While some of the work is still underway, the basic building blocks are in place.

A detailed use case for this application which is an issue tracking system for Oil & Gas companies is presented in this work. In the introduced use case, the interlinks between failure events and their associated actions are captured in a knowledge graph. To overcome data sparsity, scarcity, and non-trivial relationships, a relatively new concept called ‘meta-graphs’ are employed. Using meta-graph patterns defined on the knowledge graph schema, we can recommend actions based on the semantic relatedness of the various failure events and their corrective actions. Moreover, the recommendation results selected by the end-user and the meta-graphs evaluated by the domain experts are automatically graded during the entire lifecycle of the system for transfer learning, reliability evaluation and reproducibility.",knowledge graph,Q33002955,,

29,Yanko Ivanov,Enterprise Knowledge,The Curious Case of the Semantic Data Catalog,"Knowledge graphs have been on the rise and organizations have found a variety of use cases for the technology. One specific type of a use case is the implementation of a knowledge graph as a semantic data catalog. With the inherent power of the technology to integrate structured and unstructured information, the application of knowledge graphs as data catalogs seems to be a foregone conclusion. Capturing the semantic context of data in a smart data catalog application provides much more than simple description of the organization’s data. In this presentation we will discuss key considerations and business value of semantic data catalogs. We will also review a specific use case where we implemented a semantic data catalog for a government organization to help them track, discover, and govern a large number of data sets.",knowledge graph,Q33002955,,

30,Ying Ding,University of Texas at Austin,Knowledge Graph for Drug Discovery,"A critical barrier in current drug discovery is the inability to utilize public datasets in an integrated fashion to fully understand the actions of drugs and chemical compounds on biological systems. There is a need to intelligently integrate heterogeneous datasets pertaining to compounds, drugs, targets, genes, diseases, and drug side effects now available to enable effective network data mining algorithms to extract important biological relationships. In this talk, we demonstrate the semantic integration of 25 different databases and develop various mining and predication methods to identify hidden associations that could provide valuable directions for further exploration at the experimental level.
