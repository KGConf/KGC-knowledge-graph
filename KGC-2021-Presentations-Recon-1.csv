,Albert-Laszlo Barabasi,From Network Medicine to Food and Knowledge Graphs,Northeastern University,"Our understanding of how diet affects our health is limited to the role of 150 key nutritional components systematically tracked by the USDA and other national databases in all foods. Yet, these nutritional components represent only a tiny fraction of the over 26,000 distinct, definable biochemicals present in our food. While many of these biochemicals have documented effects on health, they remain unquantified in any systematic fashion across different individual foods. Their invisibility to experimental, clinical, and epidemiological studies defines them as the ‘Dark Matter of Nutrition.’ I will speak about our efforts to develop a high-resolution library of this nutritional dark matter, and the tole of network medicine and knowledge graphs in our journey to uncover the role of individual food molecules in our health, opening up novel avenues by which to understand, avoid, and control disease.",,,,,No presentation slides,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-2021/videos/may-6th-from-network-medicine-to-food-and-knowledge-graphs-70caf844-3bda-4bf5-b405-5ff27f179109
,Alena Vasilevich,Benefits of Collaborative AI vs. Manual Creation of the Graph: Taxonomization of IATE - the EU Terminology,Coreon GmbH,"In the realm of data-driven businesses, structured data, being highly organized and easily understood by machines, is a valuable resource. IATE, with almost one million concepts storing multilingual terms and metadata, holds a large part of the textual knowledge of the EU. However, it can only be accessed lexically, and the database concepts stand-alone. If IATE were taxonomized, i.e. related concepts linked up into knowledge graphs yielding a full-fledged ontology, its data could not only be consumed by linguists but would also become accessible by the machine-readable SPARQL endpoint, which makes it a powerful resource for AI projects, particularly within SMEs that rarely have the means to create multilingual formalized knowledge. Coreon team elevated a sub-domain of IATE terminology into a multilingual knowledge graph. We taxonomized a flat list of 425 concepts within the COVID sub-domain, benchmarking two approaches to tackle this task: automatically through a custom-enhanced off-the-shelf language model and a manual creation of the knowledge graph by a linguist expert. The automatically created knowledge graph was later revised by a human, corrections and time effort measured and compared with performance metrics of the manual approach. In this talk, we will dwell on the performance and resource-saving advantages of our custom method and show how the achieved productivity rate can make the taxonomization of even large terminology databases economically viable. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our collaborative-robot approach in a typical industry use case scenario: using the resulting IATE/Covid graph for initialization of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a multilingual document classification task, we get a classification granularity that is not reachable by state-of-the-art models, such as non-initialized CNNs and zero-shot classifiers.",,,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4876651#.YOoNMjOSlhE,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/videos/alena-vasilevich-benefits-of-collaborative-ai-vs-manual-creation
,Alex Kalinowski,Structured to Unstructured and Back: Integrated Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing Techniques,Northeastern University,"It is a difficult task for traditional pattern-based matching or machine learning approaches to identify entities and the relationships they share. These techniques rapidly overfit training datasets and struggle to transfer to other contexts or domains. One solution to the lack of transferability includes the utilization of outside knowledge, such as facts contained in a knowledge base or ontology. However, integrating unstructured data such as language models with highly structured data such as knowledge bases is a challenging research problem. Using concepts from distant supervision, word vectors, and knowledge graph embeddings, an elegant unsupervised learning approach will be presented for solving this knowledge integration problem. This talk illustrates the problem from two points-of-view: the natural language processing practitioner unaccustomed to semantics and knowledge bases, and the semantic web developer without a background in deep learning and language models.","Pattern-based Matching, ML, Entities, Relationships, Training Datasets, Knowldegebase, Ontology, Word Vectors, Knowledge Integration, NLP",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4876638,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-21-attendees/videos/alex-kalinowski-structured-to-unstructured-back

,Amar Das,Second Workshop on Personal Health Knowledge Graphs,,"Electronic health records (EHRs) have become a popular source of observational health data for learning insights that could inform the treatment of acute medical conditions. However, their utility for learning insights for informing preventive care and management of chronic conditions has remained limited. For this reason, the addition of social determinants of health (SDoH) [1] and “observations of daily living” (ODL) [2] to the EHR have been proposed. This combination of medical, social, behavioral, and lifestyle information about the patient is essential for allowing medical events to be understood in the context of one’s life and, conversely, allowing lifestyle choices to be considered jointly with one’s medical context. We propose that the personal health knowledge graph is a semantic representation of a patient’s combined medical records, SDoH, and ODLs that would be generated by both patients and their providers and be potentially useful to both for decision-making. While there are some initial efforts to clarify what personal knowledge graphs are [3] and how they may be made specific to health [4, 5], there is still much to be determined concerning how to operationalize and apply such a knowledge graph in life and clinical practice. There are challenges in collecting, managing, integrating, and analyzing the data required to populate the knowledge graph, maintaining, reasoning over, and sharing aspects of the knowledge graph. Following on the success of our inaugural workshop held at the Knowledge Graph Conference in 2020, in the second installment of this workshop, we aim to gather multiple stakeholders (health practitioners, health informaticists, knowledge engineers, and computer scientists) working on defining, building, consuming, and integrating personal health knowledge graphs.

Search-centric companies highly rely on knowledge graphs in providing the necessary information for building rich search experiences. An entity can originate from a structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data source. An entity passes through a series of stages to be onboarded into a knowledge graph and then served as part of a search result. This talk presents the life cycle of an entity including extraction, schema mapping, ingestion, entity resolution, data quality, and publishing. It covers the challenges and approaches employed at each stage. It also introduces some of the different experiences that can be generated for a given entity. Finally, it covers the multilingual aspect of knowledge graphs and the challenges of maintaining them at scale.","Entity Life Cycle, Search Centric, Knowledge Graphs, Extraction, Schema Mapping,  Entity Resolution, Data Quality, ",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4876658#.YOoVDDOSlhE,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/videos/amgad-madkour-entity-life-cycle-in-search-centric-knowledge-graphs

In parallel, we noticed immense growth in research around Knowledge Graphs from industry and academia. Most focus of Knowledge Graphs has been on its construction, however, harnessing knowledge graphs/symbolic knowledge for end tasks is yet to be well explored. Particularly, integrating information from knowledge graphs with learning techniques for solving tasks. We call this “knowledge-infused learning” (KiL), an approach to encode knowledge for using it with deep learning. Knowledge Graphs are important in its use for neuro-symbolic AI [3,5,8].

,Ben De Meester,PROV4ITDaTa: Flexible KG generation within reach (tool presentation),IDLab - Ghent University - imec,"Personal Knowledge Graph generation is no longer a cumbersome technical endeavor. PROV4ITDaTa is an MIT open-source platform to provide a smooth user experience for generating knowledge graphs from your online web services, such as Google, Flickr, and Imgur, into your personal data space. This brings your personal data back under your control, and as a graph, its true interlinking potential is unleashed. PROV4ITDaTa allows to configure and set up a web application where users can easily pick one or more web services to extract their data from, transform that data into best-practice knowledge graphs, and push those graphs to a personal data space, such as a Solid pod. All heavy lifting is included in PROV4ITData: management of service authentication (e.g., OAuth 1.0/2.0 sessions), setting up the infrastructure to extract and transform your personal data from popular web services, directly loading those graphs into your personal data space, and generating a simple user interface. Developers only need to focus on providing custom connectors to more specialized web services and configuring the data processing pipeline to generate knowledge graphs into any needed form or shape. The data processing pipeline is based on RML.io, meaning that it is extensible to any data source, can integrate multiple data sources on the fly, includes data cleansing functions, supports any RDF graph structure and ontology, and its configuration is fully declarative. The pipelines are thus more maintainable and more transparent than hard-coded solutions such as the Data Transfer Project (DTP). Where existing platforms such as DTP provide one-to-one data transfer, PROV4ITDaTa enables extensible many-to-many data processing pipelines, beyond the web services and (personal) data spaces we currently provide. All these features can easily be included in the PROV4ITDaTa platform and will be showcased during the presentation. As a result, developers can more easily support custom web services. As users can generate personal knowledge graphs faster and easier, more knowledge graph applications can be built that rely on real-world data. With a click of a button, users can try out knowledge graph applications using their actual data from music streaming systems, fitness apps, address books, social media, etc. Continuing this product, we are building a data processing workbench, where these different data processing pipeline configurations can be managed, scheduled, and orchestrated, giving companies more control, and allowing to upscale PROV4ITData more easily.","KG Generation, PROV4ITData, Open-source, Personal Data, Data Interlinking, Web App, Extract, Transform, Data PipeLine, Integrate, Extensible, Data Cleansing, Many-To-Many,",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4876645#.YPBHXT2SlhE,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-21-attendees/videos/ben-de-meester-prov4itdata-flexible-knowledge-graph-generation-within-reach

,Bernhard Krabina,Semantic MediaWiki as Knowledge Graph Interface,KDZ - Centre for Public Administration Research,"Semantic MediaWiki (SMW), which was introduced as early as in 2006, has since gone on to establish a vital community and is currently one of the few semantic wiki solutions still in existence. SMW is an extension of MediaWiki, the software used for Wikipedia and many other projects, resulting in a largely sustainable codebase and ecosystem. There are many reasons why SMW should not be overlooked by the knowledge graph community: -SMW is capable of directly connecting to several triple stores (Blazegraph, Virtuoso, Jena), which is why it can be considered an interface for entering data into knowledge graphs. -	SMW can use its internal relational database (or ElasticSearch), enabling users to build simple knowledge graphs without in-depth knowledge about triple stores. -SMW has the built-in capability of exporting to RDF including building complete RDF data dumps that can be imported into existing knowledge graphs. -	SMW has the capability to reuse existing ontologies by importing vocabularies and providing unique identifiers. -The explicit semantic content of Semantic MediaWiki is formally interpreted in the OWL DL ontology language and is made available in XML/RDF format. -	A simple internal query language is available to query the internal knowledge graph from within SMW, without the requirement of having a SPARQL endpoint. However, extensions for implementing SPARQL in SMW are available as well. -SMW has the capability to enable data curation for experienced users responsible for the ontology as well as simple form-based input for regular users that can easily populate the KG with data. -There are several approaches to visualizing data in SMW, thus making the knowledge graph visible and interactive. -Implementing custom ontologies in SMW is quite easy, everything is built-in wiki pages (e.g. definition of properties and datatypes, forms and templates). -	SMW has low barriers to implementation as it is a clean extension to MediaWiki, which is PHP software running on regular web hosts. -In the talk, I will give an overview of the mentioned aspects and highlight some main differences to Wikibase – which is an alternative approach for managing structured data in MediaWiki – as well as the current limitations of SMW.","Codebase, Data Entry Interface, Semantic MediaWiki (SMW), Triple Store, KG, Export to RDF, Reuse, SPARQL, Data Curation, Data Vizulation, PHP, ",,,,Semantic MediaWiki as Knowledge Graph Interface | Zenodo,Bernhard Krabina | Semantic MediaWiki As Knowledge Graph Interface - KGC | The Complete Collection - Knowledge Graph Conference (vhx.tv)

,Chris Welty,Shopping Sense: Bringing common sense to worldwide shopping knowledge,Google,"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) continue to penetrate the industrial world after Google's famous ""things not strings"" was used to explain their acquisition of FreeBase ten years ago. While many KGs exist, they are by and large little more than ""entity catalogs"", missing entirely the links between those entities. At Google, we recently launched a new enhancement to search that allows product queries, such as ""Milk"", ""Celery"" or ""12 string guitar"", to return local results - places on maps, nearby, that sell the product. The challenge to making this work is that 70% of stores worldwide - and 40% in the US - do not have a web page, Google's primary data source for search. To overcome this challenge and extend our understanding of small to medium-sized brick&mortar shops, we used a unique combination of Knowledge Graphs, AI and Human Common Sense, that demonstrates both the promises and limitations of AI in solving practical business problems.","Entity Catalogs, Brick & Mortar Shops, AI, Shopping Knowledge, Local Results, Queries, ",,,,Shopping Sense: Bringing common sense to worldwide shopping knowledge | Zenodo,Chris Welty | Shopping Sense: Bringing Common Sense To Worldwide Shopping - KGC | The Complete Collection - Knowledge Graph Conference (vhx.tv)

,Dan McCreary,How Graphs Improve Systems Thinking,Optum and Intel,Graphs are characterized by their ability to model relationships between entities. Graph models allow for relationship traversals up to 3-5 orders of magnitude faster than traditional relational models. This performance advantage allows graphs to include more data and different types of data than were possible in the past. Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) architects start asking questions: What other data can we include? What benefits could we gain if we began to think of our organization as a more holistic and integrated system? How do the diverse datasets interact to give us deeper insights into how to optimize our operations? This workshop will introduce the fundamental concepts around EKGs and Systems Thinking and how they fit together. We then will walk the group through a series of short exercises to demonstrate how the two concepts are related with examples.,"General Purpose, CPU Hardware, Graph Analytics, Graph Traversal, Machine Learning, Sparse Matrix Processing, Metaphors, Storytelling",,,,No presentation slides,How Graphs Improve Systems Thinking - KGC | The Complete Collection - Knowledge Graph Conference (vhx.tv)

,Deborah McGuinness,Second Workshop on Personal Health Knowledge Graphs,,"Electronic health records (EHRs) have become a popular source of observational health data for learning insights that could inform the treatment of acute medical conditions. However, their utility for learning insights for informing preventive care and management of chronic conditions has remained limited. For this reason, the addition of social determinants of health (SDoH) [1] and “observations of daily living” (ODL) [2] to the EHR have been proposed. This combination of medical, social, behavioral, and lifestyle information about the patient is essential for allowing medical events to be understood in the context of one’s life and, conversely, allowing lifestyle choices to be considered jointly with one’s medical context. We propose that the personal health knowledge graph is a semantic representation of a patient’s combined medical records, SDoH, and ODLs that would be generated by both patients and their providers and be potentially useful to both for decision-making. While there are some initial efforts to clarify what personal knowledge graphs are [3] and how they may be made specific to health [4, 5], there is still much to be determined concerning how to operationalize and apply such a knowledge graph in life and clinical practice. There are challenges in collecting, managing, integrating, and analyzing the data required to populate the knowledge graph, maintaining, reasoning over, and sharing aspects of the knowledge graph.

As part of its enterprise information governance, there is an ongoing effort to unlock research data from siloed systems, by building a knowledge graph that transcends research domains and departments. The Hyve, a Dutch IT services provider for the biomedical domain, assists in this effort by creating semantic models of particular areas, such as computational genomics or clinical trials. In this case-study, we will share our experience modelling research data in Immuno-Oncology & Cell Therapy (IOCT). Here, traceability of research data through the development pipeline poses a particular problem because most data is currently stored in particular vendor solutions and departments. We will first introduce the semantic model that was created to model the IOCT research domain and data, and how it builds on public domain ontologies and existing BMS ontologies. We will then present our efforts to build a knowledge graph by instantiating this model using a selected set of research data. We will evaluate the strategies and tools we explored to unlock as much of the data as possible, and the end-to-end use cases that can now be answered using the knowledge graph.","Immuno-Onocology, Cell Therapy, (IOCT), KG, Drug Discovery, The Hyve, Genomics, ",,,,Building an Immuno-Oncology & Cell Therapy Knowledge Graph | Zenodo,Eelke van der Horst | Building an Immuno-Oncology & Cell Therapy Knowledge Graph - KGC | The Complete Collection - Knowledge Graph Conference (vhx.tv)

The decade unfolding now is a critical period for transforming our “business as usual” routines into new practices that reduce global carbon emissions below thresholds sufficient to avert irreversible planetary damage. This workshop, hosted by Common Action – a community collaboration platform for climate action – explores how to model pathways for action. In other words, let's demonstrate how knowledge graphs are being used to spotlight where individuals and groups can contribute directly. For this initial workshop we will prioritize modeling a “backbone” of the knowledge graph for Common Action. This component is intended to track key people and their projects, and also link to related KG projects which provide complementary graph data.
In the first session of this workshop, a series of SMEs and data modelers will share 5-10 minute lightning presentations, providing glimpses into sectors across climate action. The goal of these presentations will be to share a high-level overview of the concepts and problems in the space, in order to make apparent synergies for collective modeling, and ultimately, collaborative action.

,Freddy Lecue,On the role of knowledge graphs in explainable machine learning,Inria / Thales,"Machine Learning (ML), as one of the key drivers of Artificial Intelligence, has demonstrated disruptive results in numerous industries. However, one of the most fundamental problems of applying ML, and particularly Artificial Neural Network models, in critical systems is its inability to provide a rationale for their decisions. For instance, a ML system recognizes an object to be a warfare mine through comparison with its similar observations. No human-transposable rationale is given, mainly because common sense knowledge or reasoning is out-of-scope of ML systems. We present how knowledge graphs could be applied to expose more human-understandable machine learning decisions, and present an asset, combining ML and knowledge graphs to expose a human-like explanation when recognizing an object of any class in a knowledge graph of 4,233,000 resources.","Machine Learning (ML), Artifical Neural Networks, Human Like Explanation, Common Sense, Resoning, ",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4903180#.YOh_DOhKjIU,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-2021/videos/freddy-lecue-on-the-role-of-knowledge-graphs-in-explainable-machine-learning
,Gaurav Jaglan,Graph-Based Data Science,,"Python has excellent libraries for working with graphs which provide: semantic technologies, graph queries, interactive visualizations, graph algorithms, probabilistic graph inference, as well as embedding and other integrations with deep learning. However, almost none of these have integration paths other than writing lots of custom code, and most do not share common file formats. Moreover, few of these libraries integrate effectively with popular data science tools (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, spaCy, etc.) or with popular infrastructure for scale-out (Apache Spark, Ray, RAPIDS, Apache Parquet, fsspec, etc.) on cloud computing.

,Jamie McCusker,Annotating Tabular Data Using Semantic Data Dictionaries,,"It is common practice for data providers to include text descriptions for each column when publishing data sets in the form of data dictionaries. While these documents are useful in helping an end-user properly interpret the meaning of a column in a data set, existing data dictionaries typically are not machine-readable and do not follow a common specification standard. We introduce the Semantic Data Dictionary, a specification that formalizes the assignment of a semantic representation of data, enabling standardization and harmonization across diverse data sets. The rendition of data in this form helps promote improved discovery, interoperability, reuse, traceability, and reproducibility. We present the associated research and describe how the Semantic Data Dictionary can help address existing limitations in the related literature. We discuss our approach, present an example by annotating portions of the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set, present modeling challenges, and describe the use of this approach in sponsored research, including our work on a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded exposure and health data portal and in the RPI-IBM collaborative Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics project.

,Julian Gruemmer,What can we learn from knowledge graphs? A Wirecard perspective,Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg,"The Wirecard scandal was one of the most shocking economic events in Germany in 2020. The former DAX30 company collapsed on June 25, owing creditors more than €3.5 billion (almost $4 billion) after disclosing a gaping hole in its books that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud. But were there any signs that something went wrong? In our study, we gathered all relevant information from management and supervisory board members from the 30 largest companies (DAX30) in Germany for the fiscal year 2019. Relevant information includes place of birth, date of birth, education and work experience. Our knowledge graph contains 745 people, 1.203 companies and organizations, 5.116 roles and 1.128 degrees or educational programs. All this information helps us to understand what was different at Wirecard and what may be the reasons why Wirecard failed. Using a knowledge graph enables us to automatically detect and visualize all kinds of ties between supervisory and management board members, whereas detecting them manually requires more effort and is more error prone. The collection of the data reveals that there was little to no information available for most of the supervisory and management board members of Wirecard, which is uncommon for a DAX30 firm. In addition to that, it is obvious that the management board has far less work experience than managers from comparable companies. When looking at the experience of Wirecard’s supervisory board members, it becomes clear they were little or not all familiar with board activities. Furthermore, our graph shows that supervisory board members from Wirecard are less connected to other members of supervisory boards compared to other DAX30 companies.","Wirecard, Creditors, Global Fraud, ",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4903202#.YOh5FuhKjIU,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-2021/videos/julian-grummer-what-can-we-learn-from-knowledge-graphs-a-wirecard-perspective

,Konstantin Todorov,Browsing the Web of Claims: ClaimsKG and its applications and perspectives,"University of Montpellier, LIRMM, CNRS","How do falsehoods spread on the web? This and other questions related to the propagation of fake news and biased discourse in the public area have been drawing increasing interest in different communities from social sciences to artificial intelligence. Online discourse, i.e. claims and opinions shared online, together with their associated contexts (authors, salient entities, related events) constitute a valuable source of insights to these questions. While knowledge graphs of today enable data reuse and federation, improving information retrieval on the web and facilitating knowledge discovery in various fields, they do not store information about claims and related online discourse data, making it difficult to access, query and reuse this wealth of information. Hence, we have built ClaimsKG — a knowledge graph of fact-checked claims and their related metadata, such as the claims’ truth labels, authors, topics, keywords and references. The knowledge graph is built by extracting information from a number of popular fact-checking web portals and structuring it following a specifically developed for this purpose conceptual data model mainly based on schema.org and the NIF vocabularies. Among other applications, ClaimsKG provides ground truth data for a number of tasks relevant to the analysis of societal debates on the web. In this talk, I will first present three tools that operate on the data of ClaimsKG: (1) the Claims Explorer, which allows us to navigate through our data and perform a faceted search; (2) the Claims Statistical Observatory, which helps uncover trends; and (3) the ClaimLinker, which allows linking arbitrary text to claims from ClaimsKG (or any other Knowledge graph containing claims), hence assisting the task of fact verification. I will further discuss perspectives on modeling claims in a generalized and contextualized manner, as well as related challenges such as claim disambiguation and the assessment of claim relatedness.","Claims KG, Information Retrieval, Knowledge Discovery, Claims Truth Labels, Societal Debates, Claims Explorer, Claims Statistical Observatory, Claims Linker, Fact Verification, Modeling Claims, Disambiguation, Assessment",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4903206#.YOh2G-hKjIU,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-2021/videos/konstantin-todorov-browsing-the-web-of-claims

,Mark Grover,,Stemma,"Over a third of analyst time is spent in understanding what data exists, can it be trusted and how to use it. Countless Data Engineering time is spent in answering the same questions about data - what does that column mean, how does it get populated, how often does it update and if there’s any incident going on? The answer thus far to such questions has been curation. You request volunteers to put in this information or hire project managers to make sure it does but it always fails because documentation gets out of date. The holy grail to solving this is automation - collecting metadata automatically from various data sources and creating a rich graph - of data sets, reports, humans, jobs, streams, event schemas and more. Then build opinionated products on top of it to deliver a better experience for data users. At Lyft, we have made our analysts and data scientists over 20% more productive by making it easier to discover data. Recently, we open sourced Amundsen and it’s now being used by ING, Square, Workday and many more. However, as we made it easy to discover data, it’s led to an interesting challenge. Not only is it now easy to discover good trusted data, it’s also easier to discover bad data that was previously hidden in the unforgotten nook and crannies of the data lake. Consequently, we are now asking ourselves, how can we recommend not just any data but trusted data to our users. This talk gives a quick overview of Amundsen and then goes into detail on how we have tried both automated and curated metadata to showcase what’s trusted and not in Amundsen. It will dive deep into linking the Airflow DAG which produced the data (task level lineage), linking what and how many dashboards are built from a given data set (table level lineage), as well as SLAs and historical landing times to give users signal into what’s trusted. The talk will end with an insight into current challenges and how we may solve them in the future.","Trust, Data Engineering, Curation, Automatic Data Collection, Multiple Data Sources, Amundsen, Data Discovery",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4903215#.YOhyEOhKjIU,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-2021/videos/mark-grover-from-discovering-to-trusting-data
,Martynas Jusevicius,Data-centric transformation,AtomGraph,"One of the key pieces of global infrastructure today is the web yet it continues to be developed using legacy technologies dating back to the 1960s. A result of using outdated technology in turn has created several major problems. First, relational data models are a primary contributor to the data silos problems. Second, object-oriented codebases are proliferating complexity, trapping business logic, and stifling code reuse. Third, some experts warn we are heading for a software apocalypse. And finally we’re over paying for software projects by orders of magnitude. Where do we begin to resolve these problems? In this talk, we present a data-centric transformation. We explain how RDF Knowledge Graphs, Data-Driven software, and declarative technologies can be used to create a future-proof architecture with diminishing costs.

,Maulik R. Kamdar,Elsevier's Healthcare Knowledge Graph: An Actionable Medical Knowledge Platform to Power Diverse Applications,Elsevier Inc.," Knowledge Graphs are increasingly being developed and leveraged in academia and industry to tackle complex biomedical challenges, such as drug discovery and safety, medical literature search, clinical decision support, and disease monitoring and management. In this talk, we will present the research and development on Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph, a platform built to deliver advanced clinical decision support and enhanced point-of-care content discovery for clinicians and patients. Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph uses popular linked data and semantic web technologies to capture knowledge and data from heterogeneous healthcare sources about diseases, drugs, findings, guidelines, cohorts, journals, and books. The graph is composed of medical concepts (e.g., drugs, symptoms), medical term labels and synonyms for these concepts, hierarchical and associative typed relations (e.g. drug-disease relations) between these concepts, and mappings to codes in external terminologies used in clinical data integration and electronic medical record systems. We will demonstrate how subject matter experts curate and visualize the Healthcare Knowledge Graph through novel exploration interfaces to keep the medical knowledge regularly updated, and also showcase how operationalized natural language processing pipelines continuously tag and extract novel medical concepts and relations within synoptic and reference medical content. We will walk through how Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph platform is used to provide actionable knowledge in user-facing applications in the domains of focused and precise clinical search, clinical decision support, and content recommendation. This talk will provide a perspective on how such knowledge graphs will enable the capture, representation, and provision of complex medical knowledge of high velocity, variety, volume, and veracity, to power, trusted clinical and biomedical research applications.","Biomedical Challenges, Elsevier, Healthcare KG, Clinical Decision Support, Point-of-Care, Linked Data, Semantic Web, Medical Concepts, Healthcare Sources, Curate, Visualize, NLP, Content Recommendation",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4903225#.YOhv8-hKjIU,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-2021/videos/maulik-kamdar-elsevier-s-healthcare-knowledge-graph

,Mike Welch,Serving a web scale Knowledge Graph,Verizon Media,"The Yahoo Knowledge Graph powers entity data for user experiences across multiple products at Verizon Media, from search to media to ads. Nodes in the knowledge graph correspond to real world entities: people, places, movies, sports teams, and so on. The edges represent semantic relationships between these entities. A comprehensive entity experience requires collecting a use-case specific subgraph around an entity node in the graph and combining it with dynamic and multimedia content. A ""knowledge panel"" for a public company on a web search results page might include basic data like the company's founders and number of employees, combined with a realtime stock quote and relevant images. Other use cases, like a finance-focused website, may prefer to include additional detailed information like the board members, other companies those board members represent, revenue numbers, top competitors, and more. Legacy serving systems typically pre-collected and exposed a static view of an entity, which limited the ability for clients to traverse the graph or adapt the user experience for different contexts without offline preprocessing. They also required clients to implement a more complex series of requests to fetch partial data, extract dependencies, and query additional services to stitch together their full experience. In this talk we will take you through our experience moving away from serving these static subgraph views with independent services and client side processing. We will describe how we addressed the shortcomings of such a system and built a federated, realtime, web-scale graph querying framework with GraphQL on top of Amazon Neptune, Vespa, and third party APIs. Our unified graph approach has enabled customer teams to experiment, rapidly iterate over their designs, and easily power rich experiences by bringing together all the relevant data under a single request.","Yahoo Knowledge Graph, Search, Media Ads, KG Nodes, Entities, Semantic Relationship, Fetch, Extract, Query, Static Subgraph View, Independent Services,  Client Side Processing, GraphQL, Amazon Neptune, Vespa, Unified Graph, Single Request",,,,https://zenodo.org/record/4903238#.YOhqR-hKjIU,https://knowledgegraphconference.vhx.tv/packages/kgc-2021/videos/mike-welch-serving-a-web-scale-knowledge-graph

Such annotations are a native feature in other contemporary graph data models (e.g., edge properties in the Property Graph model). In recent years, the RDF* approach has emerged to address this limitation of RDF. After RDF* gained traction among both vendors and users of RDF systems, a community group has formed to produce a specification of the approach, now called RDF-star. In February 2021, the group published a first working draft of this spec, which is accompanied by several test suites. This presentation will introduce the approach and the various features that it adds to RDF and SPARQL.","Annotations, RDF, RDF-Star, Property Graph, SPARQL, ",,,,,

Most importantly, there are components other than a graph database that are needed for a knowledge graph architecture. In this presentation we discuss these components, the tooling one needs to succeed in building a knowledge graph -driven application, and we present the idea of a “data value chain"": data flowing from legacy sources, through various manipulation steps, to a graph representation, ready to be consumed.","Customer Adoption, Graph Database, Model Information, Graph Based Application, Knowledge Graph Architecture, Data Value Chain",,,,,

Relevant data are produced and publically shared at an unprecedented pace and updated daily. Given the urgency of the outbreak and the high levels of velocity and variety of pandemic-related data, efforts have not focused on data interoperability across domains. The avalanche of COVID-19-related data streams from agencies and public and private research teams, with little coordination and without reliance on best interoperability practices, creates enormous challenges for researchers attempting to analyze the pandemic in all its multi-disciplinary complexity and develop a comprehensive policy response. With data collection and analysis efforts largely fragmented and siloed, this goal can be addressed by the roll-out of a comprehensive semantic integration platform that organizes available information into an easily queryable transdisciplinary knowledge system. We developed the COVID-19-Net Knowledge Graph that integrates epidemiological, biological and population characteristic data.

,Ryan Wisnesky,How to optimally merge knowledge graphs with category theory,," In this talk we describe a new technique for merging knowledge graphs: translating the knowledge graph schemas into categories and the knowledge graph data into functors, then applying the ""co-limit/pushout"" construction from a branch of mathematics called category theory to merge these categories and functors, and then converting the categories and functors back into knowledge graph schemas and data. We show how this process is mathematically optimal (results in the highest possible data quality in the merge), and describe several real-world use cases of knowledge graph merge that have been implemented in an open-source tool.

,Sabbir Rashid,Annotating Tabular Data Using Semantic Data Dictionaries,,"It is common practice for data providers to include text descriptions for each column when publishing data sets in the form of data dictionaries. While these documents are useful in helping an end-user properly interpret the meaning of a column in a data set, existing data dictionaries typically are not machine-readable and do not follow a common specification standard. We introduce the Semantic Data Dictionary, a specification that formalizes the assignment of a semantic representation of data, enabling standardization and harmonization across diverse data sets. The rendition of data in this form helps promote improved discovery, interoperability, reuse, traceability, and reproducibility. We present the associated research and describe how the Semantic Data Dictionary can help address existing limitations in the related literature. We discuss our approach, present an example by annotating portions of the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set, present modeling challenges, and describe the use of this approach in sponsored research, including our work on a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded exposure and health data portal and in the RPI-IBM collaborative Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics project. This work has been evaluated in comparison with traditional data dictionaries, mapping languages, and data integration tools.",,,,,,

,Steven Gustafson,Connecting the Dots with Knowledge and Data to Enable Analogical Reasoning,"Noonum, Inc.","Knowledge graphs provide a way for us to capture and relate information into a representation that can mimic expert knowledge. One type of expert knowledge that has proven to be particularly useful in industry is reasoning by analogy, or using a replacement problem and solution pair to think about the solution to a new problem. At opposite ends of the ‘representation spectrum’ are logic systems, which can easily become overly constrained and complex, and statistical approaches, which can be easily influenced by nonsensical data. In this talk, I describe challenges and successes I’ve seen using analogical reasoning and how a knowledge graph approach combined with statistics and data can overcome deficiencies in both methods. To illustrate the case, I’ll demonstrate how our financial decision support application leverages analogical reasoning in several places to answer challenging questions when evaluating organizations.","KG, Expert Knowledge Representation, Reasoning by Analogy, Replacement Problem, Solution Pair, Logic Systems, ",,,,,

,Trey Botard,Bringing Time and Truth to Semantic Data,,"Semantic systems provide tremendous opportunities to interoperate our data, facilitate shared vocabularies, and power enterprise knowledge graphs, but these increasingly distributed data ecosystems also introduce new instabilities and concerns. What happens when data we rely on is changing in unexpected ways; how do we build trust around open-access data sources; what happens if a dataset suffers a catastrophic update that disrupts the entire data system it participates in? For data to participate in increasingly expansive and accessible semantic networks, it needs to be empowered with additional traceability, security, and trust. In this presentation, Trey will show how Fluree's platform works to do just that, by building its semantic graph database on top of an immutable ledger backplane that introduces a sense of truth and time to semantic data. This talk will look at how queries drastically improve when they become temporal; how a ledger backplane introduces time-traveling data; and how trust in data expands when data can reproduce its own lineage or prove the identity of the individual or machine who transacted it. The goal of the talk is to demonstrate that additional security and trust is not only a prerequisite for more expansive & interoperable data, but also a guarantee of richer, more powerful data that extends the reach of semantics into the fourth dimension.","Data Update, Data Change, Traceability, Security, Trust, Immutable Ledger, Time Travel, Semantics",,,,,

Manual interpretation of text depends on human domain knowledge and discovery of entities and relationships in the text. This process is a highly time-consuming activity with a risk of misinterpretation. Based on the hypothesis that using Natural Language Processing techniques we can extract information and meaning from text faster than a human being, we successfully implemented a service for automatic metadata and ontology generation for a client in Norwegian public sector. This presentation will walk you through our hypothesis, the steps from text to RDF through Natural Language Processing, and our results.","Tranform, Plain Text, Semantic KG, RDF, Automatic Interpretation, NLP, Extract Information, Automatic, Metadata, Ontology Generation",,,,,

Construction and maintenance of large-scale knowledge graphs requires leveraging knowledge representation, machine learning, and natural language processing. In addition, for applications that use machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision, knowledge graphs are being increasingly used as a knowledge representation for capturing and tracking the learned knowledge. Most major AI/NLP/Vision conferences attract a significant number of research papers that leverage knowledge graphs. While several knowledge graphs have been built and deployed in the industry today, their creation and successful maintenance requires addressing numerous challenges.",,,,,,

,Xian Li,AutoKnow: Self-Driving Knowledge Collection for Products of Thousands of Types,Amazon,"Can one build a knowledge graph (KG) for all products in the world? Knowledge graphs have firmly established themselves as valuable sources of information for search and question answering, and it is natural to wonder if a KG can contain information about products offered at online retail sites. There have been several successful examples of generic KGs, but organizing information about products poses many additional challenges, including sparsity and noise of structured data for products, complexity of the domain with millions of product types and thousands of attributes, heterogeneity across a large number of categories, as well as large and constantly growing number of products. We present AutoKnow, our automatic (self-driving) system that addresses these challenges. The system includes a suite of novel techniques for taxonomy construction, product property identification, knowledge extraction, anomaly detection, and synonym discovery. AutoKnow is (a) automatic, requiring little human intervention, (b) multi-scalable, scalable in multiple dimensions (many domains, many products, and many attributes), and (c) integrative, exploiting rich customer behavior logs. AutoKnow has been operational in collecting product knowledge for over 11K product types.","KG Search, Search & Question Answering, Auto Categorization, Multi Domain, Multi Attributes",,,,,

,Ying Ding,Katana Graph Solutions: Scalable Graph Search and Graph Mining,Katana Graph,"When knowledge graphs in your company get larger and larger, a scalable graph search is in high demand. In the current graph search solutions, scalability is still a big issue. Furthermore, with the fast development of deep learning on graphs, many companies rely on deep learning methods to mine insights from the ever-increasing knowledge graphs. But search and mining are usually not available in one package. This presentation will showcase the scalable solutions from Katana Graph which provide the end-to-end solutions for graph search and mining. It is ten times faster than the current market solutions and scales exponentially on graphs with billions or even trillions of nodes. It provides weighted k-shorted path searches and cutting edge graph deep learning methods (such as cluster-graph convolutional neural network, graph attention model, and graph transformer). Katana Graph is a start-up company founded by several faculty from University of Texas at Austin with the goal to provide the scalable graph search and deep graph mining in one click.

,,"Second Workshop on Personal Health Knowledge Graphs 
",,"Electronic health records (EHRs) have become a popular source of observational health data for learning insights that could inform the treatment of acute medical conditions. However, their utility for learning insights for informing preventive care and management of chronic conditions has remained limited. For this reason, the addition of social determinants of health (SDoH) [1] and “observations of daily living” (ODL) [2] to the EHR have been proposed. This combination of medical, social, behavioral, and lifestyle information about the patient is essential for allowing medical events to be understood in the context of one’s life and, conversely, allowing lifestyle choices to be considered jointly with one’s medical context. We propose that the personal health knowledge graph is a semantic representation of a patient’s combined medical records, SDoH, and ODLs that would be generated by both patients and their providers and be potentially useful to both for decision-making. While there are some initial efforts to clarify what personal knowledge graphs are [3] and how they may be made specific to health [4, 5], there is still much to be determined concerning how to operationalize and apply such a knowledge graph in life and clinical practice. There are challenges in collecting, managing, integrating, and analyzing the data required to populate the knowledge graph, maintaining, reasoning over, and sharing aspects of the knowledge graph. Following on the success of our inaugural workshop held at the Knowledge Graph Conference in 2020, in the second installment of this workshop, we aim to gather multiple stakeholders (health practitioners, health informaticists, knowledge engineers, and computer scientists) working on defining, building, consuming, and integrating personal health knowledge graphs. The workshop will focus on the challenges and opportunities in this nascent space with a strong focus on existing PHKG solutions.","Electronic Health Records, Social Determinants of Health, Observations of Daily Living, Personal Health Knowledge Graph, Data Integration, Data Profiling, Data Curation, Querying, Knowledge Discovery, Ontology Mapping, Machine Learning",,,,,
,,Workshop on Knowledge-infused Learning,,"Research in artificial intelligence and data science is accelerating rapidly due to an unprecedented explosion in the amount of information on the web [1,2]. In parallel, we noticed immense growth in research around Knowledge Graphs from industry and academia. Most focus of Knowledge Graphs has been on its construction, however, harnessing knowledge graphs/symbolic knowledge for end tasks is yet to be well explored. Particularly, integrating information from knowledge graphs with learning techniques for solving tasks. We call this “knowledge-infused learning” (KiL), an approach to encode knowledge for using it with deep learning. Knowledge Graphs are important in its use for neuro-symbolic AI [3,5,8]. In this changing world, retrospective studies for building state-of-the-art AI and Data science systems have raised concerns on trust, traceability, and interactivity for prospective applications in healthcare, finance, and crisis response [1,4].","AI, Data Science, Knowledge Infused Learning, Deep Learning, Neuro-Symbolic AI, Probabilistic Learning, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Virtual Assistants, Human-Computer Interaction, Commonsense Reasoning",,,,,
